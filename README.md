Cortex CMS is a [multitenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy) identity, content distribution/management and reporting platform built by the [Content Enablement][cb-ce-github] team at [CareerBuilder](https://github.com/careerbuilder). Its purpose is to provide central infrastructure for next-generation applications; exposing a single point of management while enabling quicker build-out of new software.

Cortex follows a decentralized, API-only architecture - it is *not* built like Wordpress or Drupal, which are considered monolithic, all-in-one solutions.
