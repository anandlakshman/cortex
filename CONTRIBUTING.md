# Contributing

Anyone and everyone is encouraged to fork Cortex and submit pull requests, propose new features and create issues.

* Ideally, we'd first like to hear your concerns or suggestions in the form of an [issue][issue]. We can all avoid
unnecessary re-work if a problem and its potential solution are first discussed before code is written.

* Fork, then clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:your-username/cortex.git
```

* Follow the [setup instructions][setup]

* Follow the [test suite instructions][test-suite], and ensure all tests pass

* Make your change. Add tests for your change. Once again, ensure all tests pass

* Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]

From here, it's up to us. We operate in 2-week sprint lifecycles, but we'll try to get to your request or contribution
sooner. We may suggest further improvements or alternatives, or the community at large may have input.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write good tests
* Write [good commit messages][commit]
